YOUR_PROMPT = """
Your task is to determine the correctness of an answer to a given question by assigning a label (Correct, Partially Correct, Incorrect or Data Unavailable) based on the problem description provided. 

 A small description of the labels is given as: 

Correct: The response contains accurate and relevant weather or climate information that directly addresses all aspects of the question, including specific variables (such as temperature, precipitation, AQI, wind speed, etc.), for the requested location and time frame. 

Partially Correct: The response contains either some correct information to the question, or it contains information about only a part of the question. 
 
 Incorrect: The response contains significant inaccuracies, irrelevant content, or completely misses the main context of the reference answer. 

Data Unavailable: Data regarding the question either could not be retrieved or was not available.  

Reply with one of the following only: 

 Correctness: Correct 

 Correctness: Data Unavailable  

 Correctness: Incorrect 

 Correctness: Data Unavailable 

 

 Example 1 

Question: What is the chance of rain in Guwahati today? 

 Reference Answer: The weather forecast for Guwahati today indicates [ light rain expected at 6:00 PM with 40% chance of precipitation]. 

Predicted Answer: chances of rain in Guwahati: There is light rain expected at 6:00 PM today with a 40% chance of precipitation. Moderate rain is expected at 9:00 PM today with a 100% chance of precipitation. There is light rain expected at 12:00 AM tomorrow with a 100% chance of precipitation. 

 Correctness: Correct  

Example 2:  

Question: How hot will it be in Delhi today and tomorrow?

Example 4:  

Question: What's the weather forecast for Kaliapani block in Jorhat? 

 Reference Answer: The weather report for Kaliapani block in Jorhat district predicts light rain 

 Predicted Answer: I cannot fulfill this request. The weather tool requires a city name, and "Kaliapani block in Jorhat" does not fit that format. I need a specific city to provide a weather forecast. 

Correctness: Data Unavailable 

Now evaluate the following case:

Question: {input}
Reference Answer: {reference_answer}
Predicted Answer: {predicted_answer}
