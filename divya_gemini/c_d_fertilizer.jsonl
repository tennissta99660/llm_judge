You can try applying a foliar spray like Biovita/Sagarika/Mahaphal (2 grams per 5 litres of water) to provide micronutrients. If fungal disease is suspected, apply a fungicide like SAAF as per instructions.", "predicted_answer": "I am sorry, I encountered some issues while retrieving specific data for your tomato plants in Dhakuakhana, Lakhimpur. However, I can still provide some general guidance.  **Possible Causes for Drooping Tomato Plants:**  1.  **Water Issues:**      *   **Underwatering:** Tomato plants need consistent moisture, especially during fruiting. Check the soil moisture by sticking your finger about an inch deep. If it feels dry, it's time to water.     *   **Overwatering:** Soggy soil can lead to root rot, which prevents the plant from taking up water. Ensure your pots have good drainage.  2.  **Nutrient Deficiency:** Tomatoes are heavy feeders. A lack of essential nutrients like nitrogen, phosphorus, or potassium can cause drooping.  3.  **Pests and Diseases:**      *   **Aphids, Whiteflies:** These sap-sucking insects can weaken plants, leading to drooping.     *   **Fungal Diseases (Early Blight, Late Blight):** These can affect the leaves and stems, causing them to wilt and droop.     *   **Fusarium Wilt/Verticillium Wilt:** These soil-borne diseases block the plant's vascular system, causing wilting.  4.  **Environmental Stress:**      *   **Heat Stress:** High temperatures can cause plants to wilt, especially if they are not getting enough water.     *   **Transplant Shock:** If you recently transplanted your tomatoes, they may experience some temporary drooping.  **Remedies:**  1.  **Watering:** Adjust your watering schedule based on the weather and soil moisture. Water deeply when the top inch of soil feels dry.  2.  **Fertilizing:** Use a balanced fertilizer specifically formulated for tomatoes. Follow the instructions on the label.  3.  **Pest and Disease Control:**      *   **Inspect your plants regularly** for pests and diseases.     *   **Neem oil:** Can be effective against many common tomato pests.     *   **Fungicides:** If you suspect a fungal disease, use an appropriate fungicide.  4.  **Support:** Provide support for your tomato plants with stakes or cages to prevent them from toppling over, which can damage the stems and roots.  **Next Steps:**  1.  **Examine your plants closely:** Look for any signs of pests, diseases, or nutrient deficiencies. 2.  **Check the soil moisture:** Make sure you are watering correctly. 3.  **Consider a soil test:** This can help you determine if your soil is lacking any essential nutrients.  I recommend consulting with a local agricultural extension agent or nursery for more specific advice."}

Can you provide a video on managing this, and are there related government schemes for tomato farmers?", "reference_answer": "[-- youtube video-- ]", "predicted_answer": "FarmAI here! Blossom end rot in tomatoes is primarily caused by a calcium deficiency. This isn't always due to a lack of calcium in the soil, but often because the plant can't absorb enough of it. Inconsistent watering, root damage, and high nitrogen levels can interfere with calcium uptake.  To address this:  1.  **Fertilizer:** Use a fertilizer that contains calcium, and ensure it's formulated for tomatoes. Look for fertilizers with a balanced NPK ratio (Nitrogen, Phosphorus, Potassium) and added calcium. Consider a soil test to determine the exact nutrient levels and pH of your soil, as this will help you choose the most appropriate fertilizer. 2.  **Watering:** Maintain consistent watering to ensure the plant can take up nutrients effectively. Avoid overwatering, as this can also lead to problems. 3.  **Foliar Spray:** You can use a calcium chloride foliar spray for a quick boost, but this is a temporary solution.  Here are some tutorial videos that might be helpful:  *   [Tomato Blossom End-Rot: Emergency Treatment & Prevention with Lime ...](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i0febDi7iak) *   [Defeating Tomato Blossom End Rot! - YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=agIfbJXsU8c) *   [Blossom-End Rot in Tomatoes: Causes and Prevention](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QhHOKlZWH1o)  Regarding government schemes, here are some resources related to tomato farming:  *   [Tomato Farming: Business Plan And Guide For Beginners - ROY'S FARM](https://www.roysfarm.com/tomato-farming/) *   [10 Tips for Growing Tons of Tomatoes | The Old Farmer's Almanac](https://www.almanac.com/10-secrets-growing-tomatoes) *   [13 Best Tips for Planting and Growing Great Tomatoes - The Spruce](https://www.thespruce.com/top-tomato-growing-tips-1402587)  I checked the Mandi prices for tomatoes in Mau, Uttar Pradesh, but unfortunately, I couldn't find any data."}
