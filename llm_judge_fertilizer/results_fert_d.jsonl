Would you like me to do that? \n\nCorrectness: Data Unavailable\n\nNow evaluate the following case:\n\nQuestion: What is the nutrient management plan for Banana plants in Bihdia, Kamrup?\nReference Answer: A general nutrient recommendation per banana plant is: Urea - 110 g, Single Super Phosphate (SSP) - 33 g, and Muriate of Potash (MOP) - 330 g. These should typically be applied in split doses during the plant's growth cycle.\nPredicted Answer: I am unable to get the information at this time. However, you can follow these general guidelines for nutrient management in banana cultivation:  1. **Soil Testing**: Before planting, conduct a soil test to determine the nutrient status of your soil. This will help you tailor your fertilizer application to the specific needs of your banana plants.  2. **Initial Fertilization**:    - **Organic Matter**: Apply well-decomposed organic matter (e.g., compost or farmyard manure) at a rate of 10-20 kg per plant during planting.    - **Basal Dose**: Apply a basal dose of NPK (Nitrogen, Phosphorus, Potassium) fertilizer. A common recommendation is 40g N, 40g P2O5, and 120g K2O per plant. This can be adjusted based on your soil test results.  3. **Subsequent Fertilization**:    - **3-4 Months After Planting**: Apply 40g N, 20g P2O5, and 60g K2O per plant.    - **6-7 Months After Planting**: Apply 80g N, 40g P2O5, and 120g K2O per plant.    - **After Harvest**: Apply 120g N, 60g P2O5, and 180g K2O per plant to support the growth of suckers for the next crop.  4. **Micronutrients**: Banana plants also require micronutrients like magnesium, zinc, and boron. These can be applied as foliar sprays or incorporated into the soil based on deficiency symptoms or soil test recommendations.  5. **Fertigation**: If you are using drip irrigation, you can apply fertilizers through the irrigation system (fertigation). This method ensures efficient use of nutrients and water.  6. **Timing**: Fertilizers should be applied during the active growth phases of the banana plant. Avoid applying high doses of nitrogenous fertilizers during the fruiting stage, as this can lead to excessive vegetative growth at the expense of fruit development.  7. **Monitoring**: Regularly monitor your banana plants for signs of nutrient deficiencies or toxicities. Adjust your fertilizer program based on plant responses and soil test results.\n\nCorrectness:\n", "llm_response": "Correctness: Partially Correct", "decision": "Correctness: Partially Correct"}
