It covers key steps like seed sorting, nursery preparation, land preparation, fertilizer application, weed control, and pest management. *   **SRI Method of Paddy Cultivation:** [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ECWNV7IeU34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ECWNV7IeU34) - This video shares experiences on maximizing yields with minimal water usage and low production costs using natural farming practices in the SRI method. *   **SRI method of paddy cultivation//most advanced technology for paddy:** [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tP8EQKJZSVk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tP8EQKJZSVk) - This video discusses square planting, nursery and main field preparation, irrigation and weed management, and the benefits and potential drawbacks of SRI.  **2. Recommended Fertilizers for SRI in Chandigarh Soil:**  Since I don't have the ability to analyze your specific soil type, I recommend consulting with a local agricultural expert or soil testing service in Chandigarh. They can provide tailored fertilizer recommendations based on your soil's nutrient content and deficiencies. However, the first video suggests a general fertilizer application based on recommendation( N 50kg,P 12kg,and K 12kg. calculation would be DAP 27kg,urea 110 kg,phosphate 75kg, Potash 20kg for 1 acre). Also apply zinc (2gm per ltr ) for two times. One at 30days from transplantation and one 40 days from transplantation). Phosphate and Potash and ¼ of Nitrogen at the time of land preparation and other nitrogen in three times  **3. Government Schemes Promoting Water-Saving Techniques:**  Here are some government schemes related to irrigation and water-saving techniques:  *   I found a Wikipedia link that provides information about the definition of Irrigation, you can check here: [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irrigation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irrigation)  To find more specific schemes relevant to Chandigarh, I recommend checking the website of the Department of Agriculture & Farmers Welfare of Chandigarh.

A fertilizer spray containing [Simulated Fertilizer Spray Recommendation] might be needed. Please check the weather forecast for Vemulawada before applying. Yes, government soil health card schemes are [Simulated Status of Scheme]\nPredicted Answer: Reddening of leaves in cotton crops can be due to a few nutrient deficiencies, primarily magnesium, but also potentially phosphorus or potassium.  Based on the weather forecast for Vemulawada, the temperature is expected to be around 33-39°C over the next few days with chances of light rain.  Here's a general recommendation for a fertilizer spray to address potential deficiencies, but **it's crucial to get a soil test done for a precise diagnosis**. The soil health card scheme can help you with this.  **Fertilizer Spray (General Recommendation):**  *   **Magnesium Sulfate (Epsom Salt):** 2% solution (20 grams per liter of water). *   **Monoammonium Phosphate (MAP):** 1% solution (10 grams per liter of water) to address potential phosphorus deficiency. *   **Potassium Nitrate:** 1% solution (10 grams per liter of water) if potassium deficiency is suspected.  Mix these solutions and spray on the foliage, ensuring good coverage. Repeat after 10-15 days if needed.  **Regarding Government Schemes:**  Yes, the Soil Health Card scheme is an active government initiative. It provides farmers with soil analysis reports and recommendations for fertilizer use to improve soil health and productivity.

This will help you tailor your fertilization program accurately. *   **Base Application:**     *   Apply a basal dose of well-decomposed farmyard manure (FYM) or compost at 10-15 tons per hectare during land preparation. This improves soil structure, water retention, and provides a slow release of nutrients.     *   Also, apply a balanced NPK fertilizer (e.g., 10:26:26) at a rate of 50 kg per hectare before sowing or transplanting. *   **Nutrient Needs During Flowering:**     *   **Phosphorus (P):** Phosphorus is crucial for flower development and fruit set. Ensure adequate phosphorus availability during the flowering stage. If your soil is deficient, consider applying rock phosphate or single superphosphate.     *   **Potassium (K):** Potassium plays a vital role in overall plant health, including flower formation and resistance to stress. Apply muriate of potash (MOP) in split doses.     *   **Boron (B):** Boron deficiency can lead to poor flower and pod development. A foliar spray of borax (0.1%) can be beneficial during flowering. *   **Foliar Feeding:**     *   Foliar sprays of micronutrient mixtures can supplement soil application, especially during critical stages like flowering.     *   Consider using a seaweed extract-based foliar spray, as it contains various micronutrients and growth-promoting substances. *   **Water-Soluble Fertilizers:**     *   If you have access to drip irrigation, water-soluble fertilizers can be used to provide nutrients directly to the root zone.     *   Use fertilizers with a higher phosphorus and potassium content during flowering. *   **Adjustments Based on Weather:** Given the high temperatures and chances of rain, ensure proper drainage to prevent waterlogging, which can hinder nutrient uptake.
