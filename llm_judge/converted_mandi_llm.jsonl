Some effective options include:      - **Imidacloprid**: A systemic insecticide that is effective against aphids.      - **Malathion**: A broad-spectrum insecticide that can control aphids and other pests.      - **Pyrethroids**: Such as permethrin or bifenthrin, which are synthetic versions of natural pyrethrins found in chrysanthemums.
