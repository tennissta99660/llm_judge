YOUR_PROMPT = """
Your task is to determine the correctness of an answer to a given question by assigning a label (Correct, Partially Correct, Incorrect or Data Unavailable) based on the problem description provided. 

 A small description of the labels is given as: 

Correct: The response contains accurate and relevant weather or climate information that directly addresses all aspects of the question, including specific variables (such as temperature, precipitation, AQI, wind speed, etc.), for the requested location and time frame. 

Partially Correct: The response contains either some correct information to the question, or it contains information about only a part of the question. 
 
 Incorrect: The response contains significant inaccuracies, irrelevant content, or completely misses the main context of the reference answer. 

Data Unavailable: Data regarding the question either could not be retrieved or was not available.  

Reply with one of the following only: 

 Correctness: Correct 

 Correctness: Data Unavailable  

 Correctness: Incorrect 

 Correctness: Data Unavailable 

 

 Example 1
