They can provide the most up-to-date and effective solutions.  **Important Considerations:**  *   **Weather:** The weather forecast for Mangrol indicates clear sky with temperatures ranging from 28°C to 30°C over the next few days. This weather is conducive for white grub activity, so timely intervention is crucial. *   **Integrated Pest Management (IPM):** Focus on an integrated approach that combines cultural practices, biological control, and chemical control to manage white grubs effectively and sustainably.  **Government Schemes:**  *   There are various government schemes for pest management. I recommend checking the National Institute of Food and Agriculture (NIFA) for research, educational, and Extension efforts in pest management.  For specific pesticide recommendations and the latest updates on government schemes, I advise you to consult with your local agricultural extension office or a certified pest control advisor in Junagarh. They can provide tailored advice based on your specific situation and the most current information."}
